# SIIM 2025 Report Juicing Learning Lab
Welcome!  Our goal here is to review large language models with a focus on local language models with the goal of data extraction from clinical radiology reports.  The tutorial will walk you through some cases with some pre-made prompts showing that this is possible.  Unfortunately the free tier of GPU in Google Colabs is limiting so results will be suboptimal because the model size that can be deployed in Colabs struggles with this clinical task.  When you are able to try this on even a modest GPU with a 25-70b parameter model you will see remarkable improvement.
